# Using Deck with Konnect

## What is Deck

DecK helps manage Kong’s configuration in a declarative fashion. This means that a developer can define the desired state of Kong Gateway or Konnect – services, routes, plugins, and more – and let decK handle implementation without needing to execute each step manually, as you would with the Kong Admin API.

Features include:

- Sync configuration to a running Kong Konnect cluster
- diff configuration to detect any drift or manual changes
- Back up your instance’s configuration
- Manage Kong’s configuration in a distributed way using tags, helping you split the configuration across various teams
- Build pipelines of automation with APIOps

Some key features include:
