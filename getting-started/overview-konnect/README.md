**End-to-end API Lifecycle Management:** Break through API silos, inconsistent compliance to corporate standards and reuse through a central registry of consumable APIs and a platform that supports the entire API lifecycle.

**Federated API Management at scale:** Kong Konnect balances the consistency and governance mandated by the central platform teams with the architectural flexibility desired by the  application teams through a decentralized, template-based approach. Application teams can create control planes based on their own environments and add new developers to specific control planes with consistent role-based access policies.
