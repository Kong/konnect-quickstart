Custom reporting in Kong Konnect enables you to save, revisit, and share views created during data exploration, facilitating analysis over different time intervals. These reports can be used to analyze metrics, investigate anomalies, and you can share a saved report to communicate these insights with others. Let’s go through some example situations where you could leverage custom reports.

In this scenario, you just joined an organization as an API product manager. Your first task is to create a few reports that model business KPIs so that the executive team and investors have a grasp on the state of the organization’s APIs. You’ve selected the following KPIs because they would give a brief, but holistic, understanding of the APIs:

- **Number of requests:** This metric measures the total number of requests made to the API. This is good for understanding total usage of an API, and can potentially be used to uncover scalability requirements.
- **Throughput:** Throughput is the measurement of the number of requests an API can handle per minute. This metric can help you compare HTTP or database servers.
- **Latency:** This metric measures the time it takes for the API to respond to a request. This can be a good measure of the user experience when a user makes a request to an API.
