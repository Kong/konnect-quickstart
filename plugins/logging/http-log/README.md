## What is the HTTP Logging?

Logging API requests and responses to an external HTTP endpoint involves sending data related to API interactions to an external server or service via HTTP requests.

**How it works with Konnect**

1. Create a Service and Route
2. Test to see if we can proxy request with a key or no key
3. Enable Kongâ€™s HTTP Plugin
   -  HTTP endpoint
   -  Header
4. Proxy to endpoint
5. Check http logging platform (New Relic) to see logs
